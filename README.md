## 📖 About

This educational course is designed to onboard new users into the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. It will initially be delivered in Ukrainian and Russian, with an English version planned as well.

It targets learners with only a basic understanding of cryptocurrencies and blockchain, and introduces key components of DeFi — from fundamental primitives to Ethereum-based protocols, including practical usage.

All materials are free and openly licensed.

## 📚 Course Structure (WIP)

Course structure may evolve during production to better reflect community needs and protocol updates.

Each module will include both text and video lessons and finish with a quiz; the course itself ends with a final assessment that mints an NFT certificate for successful learners.


- Module 1: Introduction to Ethereum  
  (consensus, accounts, gas, L1 vs L2, wallets, etc.)
- Module 2: On-chain Primitives  
  (tokens and cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, liquidity, bridges, oracles, etc.)
- Module 3: DeFi Mechanics & Concepts  
  (AMMs, lending/borrowing, staking, yield farming, LPs, etc.)
- Module 4: Protocols
  (How to use Uniswap, Aave, Lido, EtherFi, etc.)

- Module 5 (optional): Security, Risks & Best Practices  
  (scams, approvals, MEV, frontend risks, toolkits)
- Module 6 (optional): Beyond Ethereum  
  (rollups, cross-chain DeFi, EVM-compatibility — to broaden context)

Because the course is modular, it can be logically expanded with additional blocks—for example, cross-chain interaction, a deeper dive into Layer-2 roll-ups, or advanced DeFi strategy modules. These extensions can be delivered as separate, independently funded stages if community feedback and ecosystem demand justify further development. The modules funded by the initial grant will already form a complete, self-contained learning path on their own.

## 🚧 Project Status

This project is currently in the funding preparation phase. Full-scale development and content production will begin once grant support is confirmed.

However, some initial work is already underway. While the application is under review, the project lead – Artem Galunov (Head of Research and EdTech at Incrypted) — will begin drafting the course content and outlining the production workflow.

This course is part of a non-commercial educational initiative.  

We aim to keep all materials free and openly accessible, which is why we’re seeking external support to cover production, platform development, and outreach efforts.

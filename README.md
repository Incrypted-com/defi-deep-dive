## 📖 About

This educational course is designed to onboard new users into the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. It will initially be delivered in Ukrainian and Russian, with an English version planned as well.

It targets learners with only a basic understanding of cryptocurrencies and blockchain, and introduces key components of DeFi — from fundamental primitives to Ethereum-based protocols, including practical usage.

All materials are free and openly licensed.

## 📚 Course Structure (WIP)

Course structure may evolve during production to better reflect community needs and protocol updates.

  (consensus, accounts, gas, L1 vs L2, wallets, etc.)
- Module 2: Onchain Primitives  
  (tokens and cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, liquidity, bridges, oracles, etc.)

## 🚧 Project Status

This project is currently in the funding preparation phase. Full-scale development and content production will begin once grant support is confirmed.

However, some initial work is already underway. While the application is under review, the project lead – Artem Galunov (Head of Research and EdTech at Incrypted) — will begin drafting the course content and outlining the production workflow.

This course is part of a non-commercial educational initiative.  

We aim to keep all materials free and openly accessible, which is why we’re seeking external support to cover production, platform development, and outreach efforts.
